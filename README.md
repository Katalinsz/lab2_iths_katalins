# With this project I wanted  to list some motifs from my server and make them available for "knitting" with a Line by line tool.

So far I list 4 predefined motifs. 
An interactive motif chart is visible, the stitches are calculated by colors. User can click on the rows in the chart, and the rows than will be highlighted. 
User can clik on the colors below the chart and the chart will be recolored. 

User can choose if they want a white background with green text or a dark background with blue text. 

I realize in afterhand that I wanted a too complicated project in very limited time. It took to much time for me to try to get the axious or fetch from server work. It works by now, even if it is not visible :), the data is finaly fetched, just waiting for the result and the relation with useEffect and state rerenders to many times for me. I had to give up in brist of time. 

So I am sorry, I have some issues, that I could not resolve yet:
User cannot click on the cards. 
Motifs are not loaded from the server, just listed statically. 
Motif content is not loaded from the server, just required from the fileSystem.
Tests are not written. 
The colors are listed a bit strangely.
Recoloring works, but you need to click next to the pickcolor popup to get back to the site. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
